Minilang
========

Minilang is an intentionally simple language that was designed as the
first assignment in an introduction to compilers class.  Students are
expected to write a scanner, parser, type checker and code generator
(usually generating C code).  The syntax of the language is described
in doc/grammar.ebnf and sample programs can be found under the
examples/ directory.

Minilang-rs
===========

Minilang-rs is my attempt at writing a Minilang compiler in Rust.
I've been interested in Rust for a few years now (I remember when it
was still implemented in OCaml, had a type state system and a garbage
collector), and I figured that a compiler would be a nice task to
finally learn the language.

Design
======

The crude flowchart below describes the overall flow of the compiler.


         (stdin) --> [scanner] --> (tokens) --> [parser] --+
                                                           |
+-- (Symtable + Exprtable) <-- [type checker] <-- (AST) <--+
|
+--> [code generator] --> (stdout)

Modules
-------

Below is a list of the modules of Minilang-rs with a short description
of what they do.

- *error.rs*: contains the enum *Error*, a list of all the errors that
  can occur in the compiler.
- *pos.rs*: contains the struct *Pos* that tracks the line and column of
  tokens and AST nodes.
- *token.rs*: contains the enum *TokenType* and the struct *Token* that
  are generated by the scanner and consumed by the parser.
- *types.rs*: contains the enum *Type* used by the typechecking and code
  generation phases.
- *scanner.rs*: a hand-written scanner.  Reads the input from a String
  (TODO: used a buffered reader?)
- *parser.rs*: a predictive, recursive-descent parser.
- *typecheck.rs*: type checks the program; produces a symbol table
  (map from variable names to types) and an expression table (map from
  expressions to types).  An expression table is used rather than
  writing a new AST that contains types or making the original AST
  parametrized.
- *cgen.rs*: takes the AST, symbol table and expression table and
  generates a C program.
- *main.rs*: connects all the phases together and reports errors when
  they occur.
